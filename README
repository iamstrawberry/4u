Across the miles and skies so blue,
My heart just keeps longing for you
Though you're far away, it's easy to see,
You're the only one who is perfect for me.

My love for you travels far and wide,
My heart aches for you day and night.
Though we're apart, it's easy to see,
You're the one who's meant for me.

I hope we meet, soon and sweet,
Together we'll make memories to keep.
Hand in hand, we'll stroll along,
And our love will grow ever strong.
No matter where we are, or how far apart,
You will always be in my heart.
